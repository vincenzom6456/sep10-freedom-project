            <p class="main-p-text">Architecture is a fine type of work that you may see all around you. It may be something as simple as your dresser or as complex as a huge skyscraper in Manhattan.
                Archetecture is one of the reasons that such impressive structural art can be made on structures you would never expect for it to be on. 
                Amazing architecture is around most of us and we do not even realize it, it shapes the very things we look at on  a day to day basis.</p>

                    One of these being Architecture, these technologies help with the quality of a final build or product. 
                    Most technologies are helpful in the testing phases as they help find problems in design choices structural wise.</p>

                        <li>Virtual Reality simulations this is quite similar to the computer simulations however it is more emersive, you'll be able to see what
                        your average person will see.</li>
                        <li>3D printing can be used to automatically produce small products or parts that can be used to make a larger product however, some of the higher
                        end 3D printers are quite costly.</li>

                <h2>What technology could be used in Architecture?</h2>
                <p class="main-p-text s3p">Technology as time goes on is improving at a very noticeable rate.
                For architecture in particular technology has improved substantially but what else could come in the following years?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weather/Ambience testing could be used.
                    It'll be a small hand held device that can calculate average tempurature per month extreme weather and much more.
                    Using this data the device can determine materials that can withstand these things for a long time.</li>
                    <li>With time AI has grown and become more reliable. It is very possible to introduce that to architecture as it could learn off of other successful buildings/products and make them even better!
                    Artificial intelligence is this big umbrella that has opened up more and more as time has passed.
                    Incorporating this into architecture could be a large step forward.</li>
