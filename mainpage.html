            <p class="main-p-text">Architecture is a fine type of work that you may see all around you. It may be something as simple as your dresser or as complex as a huge skyscraper in Manhattan.
                Archetecture is one of the reasons that such impressive structural art can be made on structures you would never expect for it to be on. 
                Amazing architecture is around most of us and we do not even realize it, it shapes the very things we look at on  a day to day basis.</p>
